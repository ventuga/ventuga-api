// Below is the API key for the demo site. Usually, this key will be unique to the Ventuga Client (if hosting a marketplace) and shouldn't be shared. For the demo, the application is not connected to a real world application, and the demo API will only return preset data, so we can share it.

// The API's verification key and the Marketplace's verificationkey should ALWAYS match, otherwise the marketplace will throw up an error (unverified server).
